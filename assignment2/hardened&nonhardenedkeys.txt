      Non-Hardened (Normal) Keys 
Non-hardened keys (soft-derived keys) are generated using only the parent public key and a child index number.
You can derive child public keys from the parent public key alone, without needing the private key.

Wallets and watch-only services can easily generate new addresses if they know just the master public key (xpub).

They are  useful for creating wallets that can receive payments (generate new addresses) but can’t spend them — like hardware wallets or merchant systems.

If someone gets access to both a child private key and the parent public key, they can mathematically derive the parent private key, which compromises the entire branch of that wallet.

Non-hardened keys are convenient but slightly less secure if keys are leaked.

       Hardened Keys

 Hardened keys add an extra layer of protection by using the parent private key in the derivation process instead of the public key.

You cannot generate hardened child public keys from only a parent public key — you must have the parent private key.

Even if someone gets access to a child private key, they cannot reconstruct the parent private key.

Hardened keys are more secure, but slightly less flexible because you can’t derive addresses without private access.

Hardened derivation is usually represented in the derivation path with an apostrophe — e.g.,
m/44'/0'/0'/0/0
